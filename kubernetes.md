### <ins>Kubernetes Overview</ins>

1. Kubernetes is a open-source container management tool which automates container deployment, container scaling and load balancing
2. It schedules, runs and manages isolated containers which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machines
3. All top cloud providers support kubernetes

### <ins>Problems with scaling up with containers</ins>

1. Containers cannot communicate with each other
2. Autoscaling and load balancing was not possible
3. Containers had to managed carefully

### <ins>Features of Kubernetes</ins>

1. Orchestration (clustering of any number of containers running on different network)
2. Auto scaling
3. Auto-Healing
4. Load balancing
5. Platform independent (cloud/virtual/physical)
6. Fault Tolerance (Node/ pod failure)
7. Rollback (going back to previous version)
8. Health monitoring of containers
9. Batch execution (one-time, sequential, parallel)
