# Comparison of Fine-Tuning Methods for AI Use-Cases

We compare **Full Fine-Tuning**, **LoRA Fine-Tuning**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in three applications (support chatbots, document summarization, code generation) and across small (≈7B), medium (≈13B), and large (GPT-3.5) models. We assume a **tight budget**, **limited compute**, a need for **fast responses**, and **monthly updates** of the system.

## Full Fine-Tuning

-   **What it is:** Re-training _all_ parameters of a pre-trained model on your task data.
    
-   **Advantages:** Can deeply specialize the model to the task, learning complex patterns and exact formats. This can yield the most accurate results when done well.
    
-   **Disadvantages:** Extremely resource-intensive. For example, full fine-tuning a 7B model needs on the order of 100+ GB of GPU RAM. A 13B model may need ~200 GB. Very large models (GPT-3.5) typically cannot be fine-tuned by most users. It also risks overfitting if the dataset is small. Every monthly update would require a new (costly) training run.
    
-   **Use-Case Suitability:**
    
    -   **Support Chatbot:** Fine-tuning can make the model respond in a company’s specific style and cover domain FAQs. However, it is costly and slow to retrain. Updated policies require repeated training (expensive).
        
    -   **Summarization:** A fine-tuned small/medium model can produce very good, consistent summaries if you have plenty of example summaries. But gathering this data and training is expensive for larger models.
        
    -   **Code Generation:** Fine-tuning on code examples can improve a model’s coding ability in certain languages or styles, but training on code (especially large models) is highly compute-heavy.
        
-   **Cost & Latency:** Training cost is **high** (heavy GPUs, long runs). Inference after training is as fast as the base model (no extra latency), but monthly retrains are expensive.
    
-   **Recommendation:** Full fine-tuning is **only recommended** if you have the compute budget and need a very specialized model (for example, on a _small_ or _medium_ open model where the cost is borderline feasible). It is **not suited** to strict budgets or very frequent updates; for large models it’s generally impractical.
    

## LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

-   **What it is:** Freezes most model weights and trains only small “adapter” layers (low-rank matrices). This changes far fewer parameters than full tuning.
    
-   **Advantages:** **Much cheaper to train**. LoRA can cut GPU memory needs dramatically (e.g. a 7B model fine-tuned via LoRA can fit on a single 24GB GPU). It retains performance close to full fine-tuning for many tasks. You can swap between multiple LoRA adapters for different tasks without reloading the full model. Importantly, merged LoRA adapters _do not slow down inference_ (you merge the adapter into the model weights after training).
    
-   **Disadvantages:** A tiny drop in potential accuracy: LoRA sometimes underperforms full fine-tuning on very complex tasks because it’s a low-rank approximation. It also still requires some training time and data (though far less than full tuning). You must manage the separate adapter weights.
    
-   **Use-Case Suitability:**
    
    -   **Support Chatbot:** Good choice for small/medium open models. You can adapt a model to the company’s style and knowledge with far less compute than full tuning. (Not applicable to closed models like GPT-3.5, since you can’t insert LoRA into an API model.)
        
    -   **Summarization:** Effective for customizing a model’s summary style or domain (e.g. legal summaries) with fewer resources. A small model with LoRA can do well if trained on representative examples.
        
    -   **Code Generation:** You can LoRA-tune a code-capable model on a code dataset to improve its answers; this is much cheaper than full tuning. The model can still generate code at base-model speed after merging.
        
-   **Cost & Latency:** Training cost is **low-to-moderate**. A 7–13B model can be LoRA-tuned on a single 24GB GPU. There is _no_ added inference cost when using the merged model. Monthly updates mean re-running the LoRA training on new data, which is feasible on modest hardware.
    
-   **Recommendation:** **Generally preferred when fine-tuning is desired but resources are tight**. It offers nearly the same accuracy benefits as full tuning at a fraction of the cost. Use LoRA for small or medium open models in all three use-cases. (For GPT-3.5 via API, LoRA isn’t an option – you would rely on RAG or the base model’s prompting.)
    

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

-   **What it is:** At query time, the model retrieves relevant documents or data from an external database and conditions its answer on that content. No model weights are trained; instead the “knowledge base” lives outside the model.
    
-   **Advantages:** **Always up-to-date knowledge:** You can feed the model current facts by updating the database, without retraining. This gets **latest, specific info** into answers. It **greatly reduces hallucinations**, since the model pulls facts from real sources. Sensitive or proprietary data stays in the database (not baked into the model). You also gain **traceability**: answers can be linked to source documents. Updates are easy (just add/remove docs).
    
-   **Disadvantages:** **Engineering complexity:** You must build an index of your documents and a fast semantic search (embedding + retrieval). This adds overhead to each query, so responses are slower (the system must embed the query, search, then generate). The model’s context window can limit how much info you retrieve at once, requiring careful chunking. Setting up and tuning the retrieval pipeline takes effort.
    
-   **Use-Case Suitability:**
    
    -   **Support Chatbot:** **Highly recommended**. RAG lets the chatbot always use the latest FAQs, manuals or policy docs. For example, a delivery support bot can fetch the exact help article for “reset VPN” and answer correctly. This is perfect for a dynamic knowledge base – the model itself doesn’t need retraining when company info changes.
        
    -   **Summarization:** Useful mainly for **multi-document summaries** or streaming data. RAG can pull relevant sections from many texts before generating a summary. For a single document, standard summarization is fine. But if you want the latest reports or papers summarized, RAG can gather that info first.
        
    -   **Code Generation:** Beneficial when you have large codebases or docs. RAG can retrieve relevant code snippets or API docs and let the model write code based on them. This grounds the answers in real code and reduces made-up snippets. It’s especially handy for boilerplate or looking up syntax.
        
-   **Cost & Latency:** Training cost is **very low** (no training of model weights), but you do need infrastructure for indexing and occasional embedding runs. Inference has **extra latency**: each query incurs a search step. In practice this is small for few documents but can grow if the database is huge. However, monthly updates are cheap – you just re-index new documents (no GPU training needed).
    
-   **Recommendation:** **Ideal when knowledge changes often or data is sparse**. It suits any model size (you can attach retrieval to a 7B or to GPT-3.5 alike), but benefits most when connected to a strong generator. Under a tight budget, RAG can deliver high accuracy without costly training. Use RAG for chatbots or tasks needing fresh facts. For summarization of many documents or with evolving content, RAG adds value. For code tasks, RAG can be used if you have a curated code/doc library. If latency (response speed) is _extremely_ critical, note that RAG queries add time compared to a plain model.
    

## Summary Tables

|Use Case  |Full Fine-Tuning  |LoRA |RAG |
|--|--|--|--|
|**Customer Support Chatbot**  |Very accurate answers when perfectly trained, but requires heavy compute and frequent retraining to stay up-to-date. Not feasible for large closed models.  |Cheaper way to adapt a model to FAQs with minimal overhead. Keeps responses fast (no extra latency). Works on small/medium open models. |**Best for changing knowledge**: chatbot can pull current policy snippets on-the-fly. No model retrain needed. Slightly slower due to search.
|**Document Summarization** | Fine-tuned models can produce high-quality, consistent summaries, but need lots of example summaries and big compute for medium/large models. |Good for custom summary styles on limited data. Fast inference (merged weights). Suited to small/medium models. |Useful if summarizing across many documents: retrieves relevant sections before summarizing. For single-doc summaries, overhead may not be worth it.
|**Code Generation** |Can specialize a model on code data (e.g. company codebase), but training cost is very high. Large models are hard to fine-tune. |Effective on smaller code LMs: adapts them to specific APIs or coding style cheaply. Maintains base inference speed. |Can fetch real code examples or docs to ground answers. Helps avoid invented code. Introduces search latency.

|Model Size  |Full Fine-Tuning  |LoRA |RAG |
|--|--|--|--|
|**Small (≈7B)**  |Feasible if you have a very powerful GPU cluster (∼100 GB RAM). Otherwise difficult.  |Easily done on a single 24GB GPU. Low training cost, same inference speed. |Works normally. The model’s knowledge is limited, but it can retrieve data externally. Fast enough on small scale.
|**Medium (≈13B)** |Very heavy: needs ≈200GB VRAM (multiple GPUs) and long training. Rarely practical for low budgets. |Possible with advanced tricks (e.g. 4-bit + LoRA on a 24GB GPU). Training still significant but doable. Inference speed unaffected. |Fine: can use RAG with any model. More retrieval time than small model case, but ok if not too many docs.
|**Large (GPT-3.5)** |Generally _not available_ for users (no open weights). Even if possible, training costs are prohibitive. |_Not applicable_ for closed APIs like GPT-3.5. (LoRA only works on open models.) |Primary option for specialization. GPT-3.5 can serve as generator; only way to add new knowledge is via RAG. Queries incur some latency.

**Trade-offs:** Full fine-tuning gives the best integrated accuracy but is **expensive and slow to update**. LoRA is a **low-cost compromise**: much easier to train and update, with performance close to full tuning. RAG has **minimal training cost** and allows instant knowledge updates, but adds engineering complexity and some inference latency.

**Recommendations:**

-   For **small/medium open models** on a tight budget, use **LoRA** for fine-tuning tasks (chatbots, summarization, code) whenever possible. It meets limited compute constraints and preserves speed.
    
-   When knowledge must stay current or training data is scarce, use **RAG**. This is ideal for support chatbots (frequent policy changes) and for summarizing large or dynamic corpora.
    
-   Full fine-tuning should only be used if you can afford the compute and need the absolute best task performance (usually on a small model, or when producing consistent output format is critical). Otherwise, prefer LoRA or RAG given the constraints.
