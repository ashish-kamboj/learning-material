### What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets using clusters of commodity hardware. It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant platform for big data processing.

### Explain the core components of Hadoop.
The core components of Hadoop are:
- HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): It is a distributed file system designed to store vast amounts of data across multiple machines.
- MapReduce: A programming model and processing engine for distributed data processing.

### What is the difference between HDFS and a traditional file system?
HDFS is designed for distributed storage and is fault-tolerant. It stores data redundantly across multiple nodes, ensuring data availability. Traditional file systems are typically designed for single-machine use and do not have built-in fault tolerance.

### Explain the role of the NameNode and DataNode in HDFS.
The NameNode is the master server that manages the metadata and namespace of files and directories in HDFS. DataNodes are worker nodes that store the actual data blocks and report back to the NameNode.

### What is MapReduce in Hadoop?
MapReduce is a programming model and processing engine for distributed data processing in Hadoop. It breaks down a job into smaller tasks, processes them in parallel on cluster nodes, and then combines the results to produce the final output.

### What are the Mapper and Reducer tasks in MapReduce?
Mapper tasks process input data and produce key-value pairs, while Reducer tasks take these key-value pairs as input, perform aggregation or summarization, and produce the final output.

### What is the purpose of the YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) in Hadoop?
YARN is the resource management and job scheduling component in Hadoop. It manages and allocates cluster resources to different applications, including MapReduce jobs.

 ---

### What are the benefits of using Hadoop for big data processing?
Benefits include scalability, fault tolerance, cost-effectiveness (due to commodity hardware), and support for processing a wide variety of data types (structured and unstructured).

### What is the difference between Hadoop 1 (Hadoop MapReduce) and Hadoop 2 (Hadoop 2.x or YARN)?
Hadoop 1 had a single JobTracker for job management and resource allocation, while Hadoop 2 introduced YARN, which separates resource management and job scheduling, making the system more scalable and efficient.
